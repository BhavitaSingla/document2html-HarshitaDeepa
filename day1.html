    <h1 align="center">Apple iPhone X</h1>
    <p>iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. They run <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS" target="_blank">Apple's iOS</a> mobile operating system. The ﬁrst generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, and there have been multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases since.
    <br> The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to cellular networks. <del>It supports android apps.</del><i> As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2 million applications available for the iPhone. </i>
    <br><b>Apple has released ten generations of iPhone models, </b> each accompanied by one of the ten major releases of the iOS operating system. It was followed by the 3GS with improved hardware, the 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the 4S with improved hardware and the <b> voice assistant Siri.</b> The iPhone 5 featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced Lightning connector. In 2013, Apple released the 5S with improved hardware and a ﬁngerprint reader, and the lower-cost 5C, a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal. </p>
    <code>They were followed by the larger iPhone 6, with models featuring 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays.<br> The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year,<br> which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs,<br> as well as the SE—which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. </code>
    <p><u>In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, </u> which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The iPhone X <i> was released alongside the 8 and 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera and a new facial recognition system, named Face ID, but having no home button, and therefore, no Touch ID. </i></p>
